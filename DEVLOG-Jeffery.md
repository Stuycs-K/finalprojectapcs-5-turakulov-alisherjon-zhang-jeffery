### 2025-05-23 - Create Entity class with Alisherjon and started Player class solo
Started off with both of us working on the entity class in separate ways (mine was mostly just a placeholder) and worked on our own parts for the child classes of entity. Most of the time was us talking about how to approach the work flow and the constructor for the player class was nearly done but didn't get to push.
Time: ~40 minutes

### 2025-05-26 - Progress on Player class
Using the already completed version of the Entity class that Alisherjon made, I began to recode the constructor to align with his Entity class. After that, I completed the movements of it once again making sure it works with his Entity class, and realized that we needed two more classes for the rest of the Player methods. I commented out the necessity for those two, thought a bit on how to approach the classes, and set up the devlog.
Time: ~60 minutes
