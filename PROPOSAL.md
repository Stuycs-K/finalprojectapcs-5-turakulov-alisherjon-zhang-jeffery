# IDEAS:

1. A 2d shooter with upgradable weapons, enemies that get stronger after waves:
    - wave system:
      - progresses every time a set of enemies dies
    - upgrade shop on map:
      - upgrade projectiles, damage, and defense
    - map:
      - moderately large with wall obstacles
      - some obstacles can be damaged by attacks
    - enemies:
      - vary in strength and speed, randomized, randomization skews towards stronger enemies each wave
              

2. Rythm game inspired by BeatBlock that utilizes Sound input:
    - Sound input from data file:
      - will use the beatDetector or amplitude methods to trigger events based on music.
    - Cat png in the middle, must destroy blocks being thrown at it
      - blocks generated randomly by beatDetector and amplitude of sound.
    - Different times of blocks thrown at Cat
      - some need to be clicked
      - some need to be hit by avatars curved shield.
    - Avatar can upgrade shield arc length
      - small increments
      - limit of half the area
                     

3. Fishing game:
    - multiple areas
      - fishing area on boat
      - island area to sell fish, upgrade fishing rod
      - different fish sell more
    - timed fishing mechanic
      - fished fish have airtime, must put into bucket before they fall back in the water
        - some fish are too heavy; cannot be pulled up (need to upgrade fishing rod)
        - some fish are too fast; have less airtime (need to upgrade bait)
