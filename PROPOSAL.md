1 statement of the problem you are solving and/or a high level description of the project. (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)
       -A 2d shooter with upgradable weapons, enemies that get stronger after waves:
              -wave system:
                     -progresses every time a set of enemies dies
              -upgrade shop on map:
                     -upgrade projectiles, damage, and defense
              -map:
                     -moderately large with wall obstacles
                            -some obstacles can be damaged by attacks
       `      -enemies: 
                     -vary in strength and speed, randomized, randomization skews towards stronger enemies each wave
              

2 statement of the problem you are solving and/or a high level description of the project. (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)
       Rythm game inspired by BeatBlock that utilizes Sound input:
              -Sound input from data file:
                     -will use the beatDetector or amplitude methods to trigger events based on music.
              -Cat png in the middle, must destroy blocks being thrown at it
                     -blocks generated randomly by beatDetector ad amplitude of sound.
              -Different times of blocks thrown at Cat
                     -some need to be clicked
                     -some need to be hit by avatars curved shield.
              -Avatar can upgrade shield arc length
                     -small increments
                     -limit of half the area

       -Fishing game with:
              -multiple areas
                     -fishing area on boat
                     -island area to sell fish, upgrade fishing rod
                            -different fish sell more
              -timed fishing mechanic
                     fished fish have airtime, must put into bucket before it falls
                            -some fish are too heavy to bring above water (so upgrade fishing rod)
                            -some fish are too fast; have less airtime (so upgrade bait)
